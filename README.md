# Socialmedia_data_analytics
- MSc Thesis on Social media data analytics 
- Assessing spatial and temporal pattern of nature visitaton in Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve, Ethiopia
- Data was collected from Twitter and Flickr using API (R/Rstudio)
- The data collected was cleaned 
  - The locations for both tweets and photos are resolved by keeping one photo/tweet point per raster cell which is 20 m resolution. 
  - Photo User Day and Tweet User Day: which is the number of unique users who upload at least one photo in a specific location on a specific day. For example, if a user takes a picture at a given location twice, only one need to be considered. Same thing for tweet user day
